      <p className="mb-4">
        Modern life is saturated with systems — schedules, sensors, metrics, algorithms — all designed to optimize.
        But in the process of rationalizing the world, we may have lost something harder to define: wonder, spontaneity, and meaning.
        This essay reflects on the sociological idea of <i>disenchantment</i>, particularly as theorized by Max Weber, and how it manifests in everyday culture, identity, and technology.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Weber saw modernity as a shift from magical, religious, and traditional worldviews toward bureaucratic rationality.
        In such a world, everything is made calculable. Decisions are guided not by myth or morality, but by efficiency, legality, and predictability.
        While this transformation gave rise to science, capitalism, and the administrative state, it also created what Weber called an “iron cage” — a system so efficient that it leaves no room for meaning.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        In contemporary life, disenchantment appears not only in religious decline, but in how we relate to ourselves.
        Dating becomes swiping, leisure becomes gamified, and even self-improvement becomes a quantified competition.
        We are encouraged to become "efficient" versions of ourselves — measurable, productive, and curated.
        But this efficiency often comes at the expense of introspection, slowness, and moral ambiguity.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Paradoxically, technology — while driven by rationalization — has also created new forms of simulated enchantment.
        We see this in algorithmic feeds that feel mysterious, AI art that imitates wonder, and curated experiences that deliver awe on demand.
        But are these genuine re-enchantments, or simply the aesthetics of magic repackaged by systems we don’t control?
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        The deeper issue is not whether systems are bad, but whether we've forgotten how to live outside them.
        Weber's warning wasn’t about science per se, but about a society that forgets the irrational, the poetic, the sacred.
        As students, creators, and citizens, perhaps our task is not to reject rationality, but to hold space for what it leaves behind — to re-enchant the world, not by retreating into fantasy, but by daring to feel awe in the presence of truth.
