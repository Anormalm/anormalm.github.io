      <p className="mb-4">
        To live in the present age is to inhabit a mind shaped by systems we cannot see. Not imposed from above, but woven into interface, incentive, and infrastructure.
        One does not need to believe in determinism to notice how easily attention bends — not to truth, but to design.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        We no longer access the world directly. We access it through feeds, search bars, curated menus — through structures that precondition what can appear, and how.
        The self becomes a relay of inputs and outputs, responsive but diffuse. What once felt like reflection often feels like latency — a delay before the next tap.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        If identity once emerged through narrative and memory, today it fractures into streams of reaction: likes, loops, histories we do not own.
        One might say the digital subject is not a coherent agent, but a collage — produced by metadata, driven by nudges, compressed into performance.
        Agency, in this setting, becomes a matter of pacing: how quickly one conforms, how instantly one responds.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        But even as the digital abstracts us, it mirrors us. The algorithmic self is not alien — it is us, magnified and gamified. Our desires, made traceable. Our preferences, fed back until they ossify.
        This is not a critique of technology as such. It is a recognition that mediation has consequences — and that convenience often conceals cost.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        To think clearly today requires not only knowledge, but resistance: the capacity to remain present in delay, to tolerate ambiguity, to allow thoughts to unfold without optimization.
        The challenge is not to unplug, but to reconfigure one’s relationship to velocity and visibility — to protect the margins where unsponsored ideas may still form.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        What fragments us is not simply abundance, but compression: the erosion of interiority under the weight of perpetual address.
        In that compression, the quiet labor of selfhood — slow, recursive, non-performative — becomes ever harder to access.
        And yet, it remains the only place from which thought, in any meaningful sense, can begin.
